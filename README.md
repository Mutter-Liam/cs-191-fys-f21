# CICS 191: First Year Seminar -- Math Puzzles
Hello!  This will be the GitHub repo that we'll be using for any Git-/Github-related work in the course.

## What will we be doing?
The goal of the git-related work is to give you starting familiarity with git and GitHub.  Since many of you are still developing programming familiarity, we will mostly be working with GitHub's markdown format and some of its other tools.

## Where will things be stored?
Each assignment will have its own folder, for example the first git assignment is in the ``github_part_1/`` folder.  Note that each assignment will also have its own ``README.md`` as well, giving the specific information for that assignment's requirements.
